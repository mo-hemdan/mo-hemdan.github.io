  abstract = {Recently, deep learning-based localization systems have become one of the most promising techniques due to their accuracy in complex environments. However, these techniques require large amounts of data for training. Obtaining such data is usually a tedious and time-consuming process, which hinders their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation framework for deep learning-based localization systems. The basic idea is to use a conditional Generative Adversarial Network that is able to learn the complex structures in the original training data and then generate high-quality synthetic data that matches the original data distribution. Evaluation of the proposed data augmentation framework in a real testbed shows that our technique can increase the average localization accuracy by 22.2\% compared to the case of not using data augmentation. This demonstrates the promise of the proposed framework for enhancing deep learning-based localization systems.},

  title={Indoor Localization System for Seamless Tracking Across Buildings and Network Configurations}, 
  abstract = {WiFi localization systems have become increasingly popular owing to the ubiquity of WiFi-enabled devices. However, traditional WiFi networks were not originally designed for localization purposes, and changes to the Access Point locations can significantly drop localization performance. Moreover, these systems are unable to generalize models trained in one building to other buildings due to dependencies on building characteristics and their WiFi configurations. To address this challenge, we propose GlobLoc: the first global indoor positioning system that can function in any environment in a plug-and-play manner without requiring recalibration. Towards this end, we introduce a novel concept called the “virtual environment” in which users are tracked rather than the physical counterpart. This enables the localization model trained on one environment to function in another, regardless of changes occurring in the network environment, as they share the same virtual environment. Our experiments demonstrate that GlobLoc outperforms existing state-of-the-art propagation- and fingerprinting-based systems by at least 65%. This superior accuracy is due to its robustness to changes in the WiFi environment and its adaptability to different building configurations.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
