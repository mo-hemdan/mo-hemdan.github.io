I am Mohamed Hemdan, a PhD. student at the University of Minnesota. My research interest is in Data Management, Spatial Data Science and Machine Learning. I develop algorithms for spatial data that improves the accuracy of spatial tasks like navigation, building systems for maps, providing the maps with rich metadata.
